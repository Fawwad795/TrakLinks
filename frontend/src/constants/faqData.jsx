    question:
      "Can I change the destination of a shortened link after it's created?",
    answer:
      "Yes. In your TrakLink dashboard you can edit any existing link’s target URL at any time. Once updated, all clicks—even those on previously generated versions of that link—will redirect to the new destination instantly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be able to see who clicks on my link?",
    answer:
      "TrakLink provides detailed click analytics—such as total clicks, geolocation, referrer, device type, and browser—but does not personally identify individual users. All data is aggregated and anonymized to protect visitor privacy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need technical knowledge to use TrakLink?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. TrakLink’s interface is designed for simplicity: just paste your long URL, click “Shorten,” and you’re all set. Advanced features like UTM parameter templates and custom slugs are available but completely optional.",
  },
